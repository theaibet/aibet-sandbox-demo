# 🧠 AI-Bet Sandbox – v4.1 Soft-Track Calibration

**Branch:** `v4.1-softtrack-update`  
**Purpose:** Experimental sandbox for AI-Bet v4.1 – testing algorithmic improvements for wet/soft-track conditions.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This sandbox isolates the AI-Bet model logic and data visualization tools for controlled testing.  
Version 4.1 builds on v4.0’s successful Mornington (Soft 5) and Geelong (Soft 7) validations, refining the model’s soft-track and freshness bias behaviour.
